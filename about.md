Hi there! I'm lucky enough to have worked with some great teams, and I've learned a lot of lessons along the way. My main professional interests are at the intersection of product, engineering, and growth (traditionally, sales and marketing).

More info on where I'm coming from -- 

* I founded and bootstrapped a B2B2C SaaS company, [CrowdCompass](https://crowdcompass.com), as CTO. We successfully exited to [Cvent](https://cvent.com) on inbound interest after raising growth funding. We went public a year after the acquisition, and continued the rocket-ship growth that the company is still experiencing today. In my time leading the division as VP of Technology, we increased revenue 25x post-acquisition, relaunched an entirely new platform, and won the market. Shortly after I left, the company exited to Vista Private Equity Partners.

* Based on my experience growing and managing the team and operations at CrowdCompass, I founded [Notion Data](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/notion-3#section-overview), an analytics company that ultimately focused on bringing decisional data to product and engineering management. We sold the company to [Jama Software](https://jamasoftware.com). 

* At Jama Software, I ran our growth team as VP PMM, and, along with other key members of the exec team, crafted the strategy to propel the company's growth beyond mid-size (beyond 40MM+ ARR) and stayed on through the exit to Insight Venture Partners. 

* Seeing and opportunity to double down in growth areas where traditional sales and marketing overlap, I started [Content Camel](https://contentcamel.io), a sales and marketing content growth tool. 

Despite working closely with multi-billion dollar companies, some of the most rewarding work I've done has been helping out early and mid stage companies get a jump on the competition. 

You can also find me as an [Executive in Residence](http://www.techoregon.org/who-we-are/executives-residence) at the Technology Association of Oregon.
